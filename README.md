# GHJWARE-2.0
The successor to the GHJWARE 1.0 virus.
Note: The author takes no responsibility for the operation of this virus on your computer, it is susceptible to antiviruses and if you run it, you know very well what you are doing. 


The virus is written in C#, I would like to point out right away that I am not a professional and there may be code considered inefficient (such as goto) or other bad programming practices. 
The code eventually executes a couple of payloads, makes serious changes to the registry and overwrites the MBR, it also encrypts more important files such as Documents, Desktop, etc. 

The author of both GHJWARE 1.0 and GHJWARE 2.0 is Werokowy (DSC: zegar420)  

The virus is susceptible to numerous antivirus scans, heuristic detection and its signature has probably already been registered.

You can freely modify and check the code, it is open because I do not think it is a masterpiece.
